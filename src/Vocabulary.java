        /* array: A collection of values in which all the values have the same type, and
        each value is identified by an index.

        element: One of the values in an array. The [] operator selects elements.

        index: An integer variable or value used to indicate an element of an array

        allocate: To reserve memory for an array or other object. In Java, the new
        operator allocates memory.

        reference: A value that indicates a storage location. In a memory diagram,
        a reference appears as an arrow.

        alias: A variable that refers to the same object as another variable.

        traversal: Looping through the elements of an array (or other collection).

        search: A traversal pattern used to find a particular element of an array.

        reduce: A traversal pattern that combines the elements of an array into a
        single value.

        accumulator: A variable used to accumulate results during a traversal.

        deterministic: A program that does the same thing every time it is run.

        nondeterministic: A program that always behaves differently, even when
        run multiple times with the same input.

        pseudorandom: A sequence of numbers that appear to be random but are
        actually the product of a deterministic computation.

        histogram: An array of integers in which each integer counts the number of
        values that fall into a certain range.

        enhanced for loop: An alternative syntax for traversing the elements of an
        array (or other collection).
